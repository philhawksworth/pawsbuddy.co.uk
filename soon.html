<h1>We look after your pets, while you take a pause</h1>
<p>
	We are a small, friendly home petcare service based in St Albans.
</p>
<p>
	Whether you’re away for a long holiday or just working long hours, we can visit your home to ensure your pet is cared for and exercised while you are away.
</p>


<h2>Why home visits?</h2>
<p>
	Prevents the stress and medical risks of placing your pet in a kennels or cattery. Ensures that your pet keeps its usual routine in familiar surroundings.
</p>


<h2>Over and above</h2>
<p>
	We do more.... fluff fluff...
</p>
<p>
	Provides addional ‘empty house’ servcies: we can water your plants, put out the bins, pick up your post, stock up your fridge for your return, or any other requirements you might have. Feel free to ask!
</p>
<p>
Provides you with regular updates from your pet - via your choice of text or email - so that you can relax in the knowledge that your pet is happy and well cared for in your absence.
</p>
<p>
Includes any medication or veterinary visits that are required. Should your pet need regular medication and/or visits to the vet we are fully insured to do this for you. We believe that manitaining a routine is particularly important for animals that are elderly or in ill health.

	We do more than just cats and dogs.... Caters for dogs, puppies, cats, kittens and small caged animals. We are happy to accomodate any special requirements your pet may have, however big or small!
