<h1>Dogs</h1>


<h2>Dog walking</h2>
<p>
  We offer dog walking for £16 per hour, or £18 for two dogs from the same household. Walks will be off lead and in small groups of no more than 4 dogs. Dogs within each group are assessed for their suitability to walk together. We will drive to your home and collect your dog for their walk.
</p>

<h2>Puppies</h2>
<p>
  For dogs aged 3-12 months we adhere to the 5 minutes per month walking time rule. So a puppy of 6 months would be walked for no longer than 30 minutes. This allows them to be gradually introduced to our existing dogs with a view to being integrated into a small group for longer walks. Cost starts at £14 per walk.
</p>
