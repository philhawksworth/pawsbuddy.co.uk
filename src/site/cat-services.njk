<h1>Cats, Kittens & Small Animals</h1>
<p>
  We aim to tailor our home pet care package to your specific needs, so that you only pay for what you are getting. Even if you have more than one pet, we will only charge per visit.
</p>

<h2>Why home visits?</h2>
<p>
  Having a home pet carer prevents the stress and medical risks of placing your pet in a cattery or other unfamiliar environment. Staying at home while you are away ensures that your pet keeps its usual routine in familiar surroundings.
</p>

<h2>Home visits</h2>
